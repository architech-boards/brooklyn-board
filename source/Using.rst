Emulation of MAX3232
--------------------

This device is a RS232 converter, and require 2 serial channel (each one connected to terminal software) for full test.
The first one is used for commands and the second one must be connected, for complete testing purpose, to MAX3232 Pmod serial connector (by standard modem cable).
